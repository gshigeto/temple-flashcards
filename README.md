## Temple Experience
While on my mission in Tokyo Japan, my father passed away from a sudden heart attack. I felt alone as I was half way across the world from my family during this time. I was given the decision to return home or stay on my mission. While in the Tokyo Japan Temple, I remembered something that my father told me while preparing to leave for my mission. He said,
>"If anything happens to our family while you are out in Japan, ***stay on your mission***! "

Remembering that experience while in the temple helped me stay on my mission. I will never forget that time of my life.
